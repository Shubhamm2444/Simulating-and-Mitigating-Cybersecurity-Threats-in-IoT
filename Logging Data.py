Data Collection and Analysis
Collect data on the performance and security of the IoT network using logging and monitoring tools.

Code Example: Logging Data

import logging

logging.basicConfig(filename='iot_security.log', level=logging.INFO)

def log_message(message):
    logging.info(f"{datetime.datetime.now()}: {message}")

log_message("Test message")



Expected Outcomes
A functioning IoT network with simulated security threats.
Data and analysis on the impact of these threats.
A set of validated security measures and best practices for securing IoT devices.
